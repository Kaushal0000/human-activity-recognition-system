# Human-Activity-Recognition-System-

## 📌 Project Description  
The **Human Activity Recognition System** is a deep learning-based model that classifies human activities in real-time using a camera. The system detects activities like **dancing, yoga, walking, running, and various exercises** by processing image-based inputs.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Real-time activity recognition using a camera  
✅ Classification of **15 different activities**  
✅ Deep learning-based image classification model  
✅ Web-based frontend to trigger recognition  
✅ Supports both **pre-recorded images** and **live camera feed**  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** (for model training & inference)  
- **OpenCV** (for real-time camera input)  
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** (for deep learning)  
- **Flask or FastAPI** (for backend API)  


## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset consists of labeled images stored in CSV files:  
- **`Training_set.csv`** → Contains `filename` and `label` columns.  
- **`Testing_set.csv`** → Contains `filename` column (used for evaluation).  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup
